A simple portfolio website using HTML5 and CSS3 involves crafting a clean, visually appealing layout that highlights your work and skills. Start with a basic HTML5 structure, including a header, main section, and footer. In the header, include your name or logo and navigation links to sections.

The main section is divided into subsections. The "About" section includes a brief introduction and your photo. The "Projects" section showcases your work with images, descriptions, and links. The "Contact" section has a form for visitors to reach you, with fields for name, email, and message.

CSS3 is used to style the website, ensuring it's responsive and visually appealing. Use a grid or flexbox layout for a clean structure. Choose a color scheme and typography that reflect your personal brand. Add hover effects to buttons and project links for interactivity. Include media queries to ensure the site looks good on various devices.

Overall, keep the design simple and focused on showcasing your work effectively. This approach not only highlights your skills but also provides a professional online presence.
